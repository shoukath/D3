	Included with this quiz are two CSV files, cluster-disk-util.csv and cluster-locations.csv. Write the appropriate code to: graph the sum total of the disk utilization for all clusters over time. This must include the ability to separate utilization by region via drop down of country codes. Solution must be able to be opened in a web browser. If the CSV files were swapped out and the data refreshed, the solution should be able to be plotted by your code without modification.

	You can use any graphing libraries of your choice to parse and plot the .csv data according to the question.  Output must be in html can be opened in a browser.  Please include all code and the resulting graph in the solution submission.

	1. Graph the sum total of the disk utilization for all clusters over time
	2. Include the ability to separate utilization by region via drop down of country codes

	Other Questions
	1. Let's say that a cluster does not report data for several days.  How can we account for this problem and still get fairly accurate data in the algorithm and code that you wrote? 
	2. Map
